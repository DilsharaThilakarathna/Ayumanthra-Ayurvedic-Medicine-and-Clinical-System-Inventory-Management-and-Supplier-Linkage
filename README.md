🌿 Ayumanthra – Ayurvedic Medicine and Clinical System

Inventory Management & Supplier Linkage Module (MERN Stack)

🌱 Project Overview

Ayumanthra is a full-featured Ayurvedic healthcare platform built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The system aims to make Ayurvedic wellness accessible to both rural and urban communities.

This repository focuses on the Inventory Management & Supplier Linkage modules, which are critical for maintaining medicine availability, supplier communication, and smooth operational workflows.

🔧 My Contribution – Inventory Management & Supplier Linkage

I developed the Inventory Management and Supplier Linkage modules with advanced automation and notifications to ensure efficient operations:

📦 Inventory Management Features

Real-time tracking of medicine and ingredient stock levels

Automatic notifications for:

Low stock

Out-of-stock items

About-to-expire products

Expired products

Discount recommendations for project managers when products are in high stock and near expiration

Centralized inventory management to prevent shortages and reduce waste

🤝 Supplier Linkage Features

Supplier-specific notifications based on product categories:

Example: If turmeric (Skin Care category) is low in stock, only suppliers linked to Skin Care products receive alerts

Notifications triggered for suppliers when:

Stock is low

Stock is out of stock

Products are about to expire or expired

Allows suppliers to choose their preferred product categories, ensuring relevant alerts

Streamlined communication between inventory and suppliers for timely restocking

🛠️ Technology Stack

Frontend: React.js, CSS, HTML

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB

Others: REST APIs, JWT Authentication, Automated Notifications

🌟 Impact

Reduced risk of stock shortages and expired products
